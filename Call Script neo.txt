Hi there! This is Alex and I’m on a recorded line. How are you doing today?,
I'm reaching out regarding your inquiry about Medicare Advantage Plans Can I ask if you currently have Medicare PART A and B active,
That’s great to hear! Just to get a better understanding do you happen to pay any co-pays when visiting your primary doctor or specialist,
And do you have any secondary insurance like Humana Aetna or Blue Cross Blue Shield?,
I’d also like to know if you pay for your prescription medications or if you have drug coverage,
Do you have any coverage for Dental Vision or Hearing services,
Given that it's the Special Enrollment Period you might qualify for extra benefits with zero-dollar premiums,
We can assist you with various extra benefits such as dental and vision coverage, This includes services like dental implants crowns braces and regular cleanings, You’ll also have optical coverage which can get you a free pair of glasses or contact lenses, Plus you might qualify for free transportation services as well,
By the way besides Medicare do you also have Medicaid,
Let me ask you a few more questions,
Do you make your own decisions regarding Medicare or do you have a legal Power of Attorney,
Do you have any military plans such as TriCare or VA,
Are you receiving any health care benefits from the state or an employer,
Have you made any changes to your Medicare plan in the last 90 days,
To provide you with the best options could you please tell me your age,
What is your date of birth,
May I have your ZIP code please,
How do you pronounce your first and last name,
Now I’m going to connect you with a Medicare specialist in your area who can guide you through these benefits at no cost. Before I do that could you quickly grab your red white and blue Medicare card Having it handy will help during your conversation with the licensed Medicare advisor. Just let me know when you have the card ready,
For compliance purposes I’ll play a brief disclaimer recording for you regarding callback consent in case the line disconnects Once it’s finished, please acknowledge with a simple YES if you agree or NO if you don’t and stay on the line,
Thank you for your patience! This call typically takes around 15 to 20 minutes to provide you with all the necessary information. An operator will ask for your name ZIP code and date of birth then check if they can connect you with a licensed agent. So when they ask please say yes so they can connect you with a licensed insurance agent right away,
Once the licensed insurance agent comes on the line they’ll ask how they can help you Please respond that you’re looking to save some money or increase your benefits.
Now I’d like to make an inbound call on your behalf to the licensed agent. Do I have your approval to proceed with that?,
